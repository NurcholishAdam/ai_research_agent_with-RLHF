# Research automatically captures outputs for feedback
agent = create_agent()
result = agent.invoke({
    "research_question": "Your research question",
    "session_id": "unique_session_id"
})

# RLHF data automatically captured in result["rlhf_feedback"]
```

### 2. Collect Human Feedback
```python
# Through web interface or programmatically
feedback_collector = FeedbackCollector()
feedback = feedback_collector.collect_human_feedback(
    output_id=result["rlhf_feedback"]["final_output_id"],
    feedback_type=FeedbackType.QUALITY,
    rating=FeedbackRating.EXCELLENT,
    comments="Great comprehensive analysis!",
    user_id="researcher_123"
)
```

### 3. Train and Improve
```python
# Automated training when sufficient feedback available
from rlhf.rl_trainer import run_rlhf_training

# Training automatically triggered or manually initiated
training_results = run_rlhf_training(
    num_episodes=100,
    batch_size=16
)
```

### 4. Monitor Performance
```python
# Get feedback statistics and training metrics
stats = feedback_collector.get_feedback_statistics()
print(f"Total feedback: {stats['total_feedback']}")
print(f"Average quality: {stats['average_quality_rating']}")
```
